Gonk Avoidance:
How to play - left and right arrow keys to select a unit, then hit space bar to
confirm that unit. Then you can use left, right, up, and down to select
a tile to travel to. Once you have settled on a tile hit space bar
and your unit will then travel there.

If you want to undo that action hit the "z" key this will undo the action and
return your unit to it's previous spot and if you would like to confirm this
undo hit space bar and you will be able to select a unit to move again.

If you want to redo your undo action hit the "y" key this will redo the action
you chose to undo.

You are limited to one undo action which in turn gives you a single redo action.

Once you are happy with how you moved your unit hit the space bar to
confirm that movement. Once confirmed the AI will then move to a tile
that is near one of your units (they target the closest unit from
where they are).
